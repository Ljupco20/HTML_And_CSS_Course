    <section id="section">
      The section element is used to identify content that is a major
      sub-section of a larger whole. For example, if you’ve posted a long-form
      ebook in HTML format, it would be reasonable to wrap each chapter in a
      section element. Likewise, if you have a sidebar (semantically wrapped in
      aside tags) that contains four sections – ads, a search prompt, related
      posts, and a newsletter signup form – it would be ok to wrap each of these
      four sections in section tags since a written outline of the sidebar
      contents would include a line item for each of the four sections.
    </section>
    <article id="article">
      If your website includes blog posts, articles, or any other content that
      could just as well appear on another website as syndicated content, wrap
      that content in an article post. You can use an article element just about
      anywhere other than nested within an address element, but in most cases an
      article element will be a direct descendant of a main element or of a
      section element that is a direct descendant of a main element.
    </article>
    <aside id="aside">
      If your website contains information that isn’t directly related to the
      main content of the page, it would be appropriate to wrap that information
      in aside tags. For example, if you write a post that includes some
      technical terms, and you add definitions for those terms in a sidebar, it
      would make sense to wrap those definitions in aside tags. It is also
      common for the entire sidebar of a blog-type website to be wrapped in
      aside tags to make it clear that the sidebar is not part of the primary
      content of the page.
