          <p>
            Good nutrition is lifestyle not a diet. It starts with a new way of
            thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food
            for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
            lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big
            results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free
            mobile apps available to help track tour activity level and calories
          </p>
          <p>
            Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow
            yourself to one "cheat" meal a week
          </p>
